#define MAXIMUM_LOOPS 50;

// Experiment to determine:
// Maximum speed in linear and angular.
/* To test for max speed, increase slowly until you get to a point
where the robot never attains the speed and then back down
to a number it reaches consistently.
Note that if you are on the edge, it will reach the speed,
but with different times every run because it is struggling,
or because the motors are not consistent.
Bump it down a couple of 10th's of a m/s.
I found the max to be 0.82,
but I'm using 0.80 as a maximum to keep it consistent.

NOTE: Max speed with the wheels in the air is NOT
going to work with the wheels on the ground!
*/
// Acceleration in linear and angular.
/* Use the max speed you obtained above,
and look at the time required to reach it.
Do this at least 10 times, and either use an average,
or just use the number that comes up most often.

NOTE: It may make more sense to test the acceleration
with the robot actually moving itself, not blocked up.
You can get your max speed blocked up, but then test
it again on a surface, and test acceleration there too.
Acceleration is both slowed by having friction,
but also the wheels hunt a bit to find full speed when they
have no friction, even passing the requested speed.
*/
// Minimum speed in linear and angular.
/* This is a bit more of a judgement call.
Basically find a speed where it will operate continuously
without being jerky.
It is pretty obvious when it is surging, vs. when it can
actually maintain the speed.
I suggest you COMMENT OUT the line toward the bottom that
stops the robot when it reaches speed so that it will just run at the
slow speed forever, and then watch to see if it is jerky.
It shouldn't run away from you very far at this rate. :)
*/

/*
    The acceleration will vary by about 200ms, because
    the cycle is 100ms, so it can fall across that.
    If you find it varying a lot though, you probably
    have the max speed too high and it is hunting or
    struggling.
    Bump it down a notch so it can be consistent.
    I find I get 7 or 8 runs with identical acceleration
    times.
*/

/* NOTICE how the angular is in rad/s
In theory you can just set the result below in m/s,
but ROS will send it in rad/s and the tunable
parameters for rotation are in rad/s, not m/s
because m/s requires knowing the geometry of the robot,
as the formula below illustrates. */
