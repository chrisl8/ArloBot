/*
   NOTE About Gyro module:
   Currently this code makes NO use of the gyro. The Odometry from the ArloBot's
   wheel encoders is excellent! The only thing I do with the gyro is send the
   data to ROS and display it on the web interface. At some point a ROS node
   could use that data to detect a serious issue, like the robot being picked up
   or being stuck. As it is though, mapping works very well off of
   the Odometry without using the gyro data.
