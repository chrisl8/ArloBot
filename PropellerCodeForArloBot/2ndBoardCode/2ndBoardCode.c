/* ATTENTION! ATTENTION! ATTENTION! ATTENTION! ATTENTION! ATTENTION!
NOTE: This code is for the DHB-10 Motor Controller that comes with the new Parallax Arlo kit.
You MUST edit the settings in
~/.arlobot/per_robot_settings_for_propeller_c_code.h
based on the physical layout of your robot!
For each QUESTION:
UNCOMMENT '#define' lines for any included items,
COMMENT '#define' lines for anything that is not included.
For each SETTING:
Set the variable as required, noting that usually these are ignored if the preceding QUESTION is commented out.

Example, My robot has a "Thing1", but not a "Thing2"
*/
#define hasThingOne
//#define hasTHingTwo

/* Just like that, comment out the "has" line for things you do not have,
and if you do have the thing, adjust the numbers on the other definition as needed.
By using the #define lines, code for items you do not have is never seen by the compiler and is never even loaded on the
Propeller board, saving memory and avoiding any errors or crashes caused by unused code. */
