        # New idea here:
        # First, I do not think that this can be used for reliable for map generation.
        # If your room has objects that the Kinect
        # cannot map, then you will probably need to modify the room (cover mirrors, etc.) or try
        # other laser scanner options.
        # SO, since we only want to use it for cost planning, we should modify the data, because
        # it is easy for it to get bogged down with a lot of "stuff" everywhere.

        # From:
        # http://answers.ros.org/question/11446/costmaps-obstacle-does-not-clear-properly-under-sparse-environment/
        # "When clearing obstacles, costmap_2d only trusts laser scans returning a definite range.
        # Indoors, that makes sense. Outdoors, most scans return max range, which does not clear
        # intervening obstacles. A fake scan with slightly shorter ranges can be constructed that
        # does clear them out."
        # SO, we need to set all "hits" above the distance we want to pay attention to to a distance very far away,
        # but just within the range_max (which we can set to anything we want),
        # otherwise costmap will not clear items!
        # Also, 0 does not clear anything! So if we rotate, then it gets 0 at that point, and ignores it,
        # so we need to fill the unused slots with long distances.
        # NOTE: This does cause a "circle" to be drawn around the robot at the "artificialFarDistance",
        # but it shouldn't be a problem because we set
        # artificial_far_distance to a distance greater than the planner uses.
        # So while it clears things, it shouldn't cause a problem, and the Kinect should override it for things
        # in between.

        # Use:
        # roslaunch arlobot_ros view_robot.launch
        # to view this well for debugging and testing.

        # Note that sensor orientation is important here!
        # If you have a different number or aim them differently this will not work!
        # The offset between the pretend sensor location in the URDF
        # and real location needs to be added to these values. This may need to be tweaked.
        sensor_offset = 0.217  # Measured, Calculated: 0.22545
        # This will be the max used range, anything beyond this is set to "artificial_far_distance"

        # Maximum distance accepted from the PING sensors.
        # Anything longer than this is assumed to be "no obstacle"
        # If we accept things too far away, we get too much noise.
        # 0.5 is a good default. Sometimes it is useful to extend it for testing
        # in RVIZ
        max_range_accepted = rospy.get_param("/arlobot/maxPingRangeAccepted", 0.5)

        # max_range_accepted Testing:
        # I think it is a trade-off, so there is no end to the adjustment that could be done.
        # I did a lot of testing with gmapping while building a map.
        # Obviously this would be slightly different from using a map we do not update.
        # It seems there are so many variables here that testing is difficult.
        # We could find one number works great in one situation but is hopeless in another.
        # Having a comprehensive test course to test in multiple modes for every possible value would be great,
        # but I think it would take months! :)
        # REMEMBER, the costmap only pays attention out to a certain set
        # for obstacle_range in costmap_common_params.yaml anyway.
        # Here are my notes for different values of "max_range_accepted":
        # 1 - looks good, and works ok, but
        # I am afraid that the costmap gets confused with things popping in and out of sight all of the time,
        # causing undue wandering.
        # 2 - This producing less wandering due to things popping in and out of the field of view,
        # BUT it also shows that we get odd affects at longer distances. i.e.
        #     A door frame almost always has a hit right in the middle of it.
        #     In a hallway there is often a hit in the middle about 1.5 meters out.
        # .5 - This works very well to have the PING data ONLY provide obstacle avoidance,
        # and immediately forget about said obstacles.
        #     This prevents the navigation stack from fighting with the Activity Board code's
        # built in safety stops, and instead navigate around obstacles before the Activity Board
        # code gets involved (other than to set speed reductions).
        #     The only down side is if you tell ArloBot to go somewhere that he cannot due to low obstacles,
        # he will try forever. He won't just bounce off of the obstacle,
        #     but he will keep trying it and then go away, turn around,
        # and try again over and over. He may even start wandering around
        # the facility trying to find another way in,
        #     but he will eventually come back and try it again.
        #     I'm not sure what the solution to this is though,
        # because avoiding low lying obstacles and adding low lying
        # features to the map are really two different things.
        #     I think if this is well tuned to avoid low lying obstacles it
        # probably will not work well for mapping features.
        #     IF we could map features with the PING sensors, we wouldn't need the 3D sensor. :)
        # Right now when the robot spins, it clears the obstacles behind it,
        # because there are fewer sensors on the back side.
        # If the obstacle was seen all of the way around the robot, in the same spot,
        # it may stop returning to the same location as soon as it turns around?

        #     NOTE: The bump sensors on Turtlebot mark but do not clear.
        # I'm not sure how that works out. It seems like every bump would
        # end up being a "blot" in the landscape never to be returned to,
        # but maybe there is something I am missing?

        # NOTE: Could this be different for PING vs. IR?
        # Currently I'm not using IR! Just PING. The IR is not being used by costmap.
        # It is here for seeing in RVIZ, and the Propeller board uses it for emergency stopping,
        # but costmap isn't watching it at the moment. I think it is too erratic for that.
