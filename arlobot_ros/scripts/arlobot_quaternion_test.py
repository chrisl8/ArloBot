        This will stall until the move_base comes up,

        Note, the actual pose on the map is not the same as this,

        What there is the odometry based pose, and then a transform
        from the odometry to the map.
        Retriving the transform, combining it with the odom pose
        and making use of it is a future exercise.

        If the odometry, which is tied to /base_link, was identical
        to the map location, this would tell it to go nowhere,

        to move the robot the difference between the odom (/base_link)
        and the map. :)

        a quick and easy way to get the transform from the /map to /base_link is to use the command-line tool:
