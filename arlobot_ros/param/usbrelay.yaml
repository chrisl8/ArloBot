# These are the relays on the SainSmart 8 port USB model
# Some customization will be required if you want to use a different model
# If you want to DISABLE the entire USB Relay, change usbRelayInstalled in ~/.arlobot/arlobot.yaml
# relays that are not enabled will be ignored, as in no status, no on or off commands sent.
# The label can be used by other nodes to request on/off, so be careful renaming stuff as it could be embedded in code somewhere!
