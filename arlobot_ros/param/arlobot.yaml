# Note, the port where your Propeller is plugged in can be found with a script now,
# This is in the scripts folder called ~/dev_ws/src/ArloBot/scripts/find_ActivityBoard.sh
# So you can run this to set the port once roscore is started, but before starting Arlobot:
# rosparam set /arlobot/port $(~/dev_ws/src/ArloBot/scripts/find_ActivityBoard.sh)
#port: /dev/ttyUSB1

# I always use 115200 for the ActivityBoard

# trackWidth [m], distancePerCount [m]
# https://learn.parallax.com/activitybot/calculating-angles-rotation
# Track Width for Arlo is from measurement and then testing
# You can customize this if you think you have better numbers please post a note in GitHub for me!
# HB-25 numbers;
#driveGeometry: {trackWidth: 0.403, distancePerCount: 0.00676}
# DHB-10 numbers:
driveGeometry: { trackWidth: 0.403, distancePerCount: 0.00338, wheelSymmetryError: 1.0 }
# Note that updates to trackWidth & distancePerCount will be sent to the robot in real time.
# A wheelSymmetryError of 1.0 means no error. See README.md about calibration for help on setting it,
# but in short it accounts for a difference in left/right wheel diameter.
