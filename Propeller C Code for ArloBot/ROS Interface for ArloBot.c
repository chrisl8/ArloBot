        /* Restructuring this so that it updates the drive_speed on EVERY

           from ROS, we will still account for updates in the speed limit
           from the SaftyOverride cog by recalculating the drive commands
           based on the new speed limit at every loop.*/

        // Prevent saturation at max wheel speed when a compound command is sent.
        /* Without this, if your max speed is 50, and ROS asks us to set one wheel
           at 50 and the other at 100, we will end up with both at 50
           changing a turn into a straight line!
           This is because arlodrive.c just cuts off each wheel at the set max speed
           with no regard for the expected left to right wheel speed ratio.
           Here is the code from arlodrive.c:
           int abd_speedLimit = 100;
           static int encoderFeedback = 1;

           void drive_setMaxSpeed(int maxTicksPerSec) {
           abd_speedLimit = maxTicksPerSec;
           }
           ...
           void set_drive_speed(int left, int right) {
           if(encoderFeedback) {
           if(left > abd_speedLimit) left = abd_speedLimit;
           if(left < -abd_speedLimit) left = -abd_speedLimit;
           if(right > abd_speedLimit) right = abd_speedLimit;
           if(right < -abd_speedLimit) right = -abd_speedLimit;
           }}
           ...

           So clearly we need to "normalize" the speed so that if one number is truncated,
           the other is brought down the same amount, in order to accomplish the same turn
           ratio at a slower speed!
           Especially if the max speed is variable based on parameters within this code,
           such as proximity to walls, etc.

       I sending ALL of the proximity data (IR and PING sensors) to ROS
       over the "odometry" line, since it is real time data which is just as important
       as the odometry, and it seems like it would be faster to send and deal with one packet
       per cycle rather than two.

       In the propeller node I will convert this to fake laser data.
       I have two goals here:
       1. I want to be able to visualize in RVIZ what the sensors are reporting. This will help with debugging
       situations where the robot gets stalled in doorways and such due to odd sensor readings from angled
       surfaces near the sides.
       2. I also want to use at least some of this for obstacle avoidance in AMCL.
       Note that I do not think that IR and PING data will be useful for gmapping, although it is possible.
       It is just too granular and non specific. It would be nice to be able to use the PING (UltraSonic) data
       to deal with mirrors and targets below the Kinect/Xtion, but I'm not sure how practical that is.
