// My goal here is to make this as close to AIRBNB as possible,
// while still using Prettier, which takes care of all the questions and
// keeping things VERY consistent.
// To test things, comment the long extends line, uncomment the one that just has 'airbnb'
// and comment out the prettier rule,
// This will leave you with just AirBNB, and see if it agrees mostly.

// One compromise I made was to ALWAYS use parens on arrow function arguments,
// because it makes both AirBNB and Prettier happy and is automatic.
// Less thinking is better than perfect and/or my preferences.
