# Note, the port where your Propeller is plugged in can be found with a script now,
# This is in the scripts folder called ~/catkin_ws/src/ArloBot/scripts/find_ActivityBoard.sh
# So you can run this to set the port once roscore is started, but before starting Arlobot:
# rosparam set /arlobot/port $(~/catkin_ws/src/ArloBot/scripts/find_ActivityBoard.sh)
#port: /dev/ttyUSB1
# I alwyas use 115200 for the ActivityBoard
baudRate: 115200

# Track Width for Arlo is from measurement and then testing
# You can customize this if you think you have better numbers please post a note in GitHub for me!

# Note that updates to tracWidth & distancePerCount will be sent to the robot in real time.
