# Note, the port where your Propeller is plugged in can be found with a script now,
# This is in the Metatron package called ~/metatron/scripts/find_propeller.sh
# So you can run this to set the port once roscore is started, but before starting Arlobot:
# rosparam set /arlobot/port $(~/metatron/scripts/find_propeller.sh)
#port: /dev/ttyUSB1
