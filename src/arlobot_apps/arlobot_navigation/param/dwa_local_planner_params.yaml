# Robot Configuration Parameters - Arlobot
  max_vel_x: 0.6
  min_vel_x: 0.0
  # Setting min_vel_x above zero means robot will never spin in place!

  max_vel_y: 0.0  # diff drive robot
  min_vel_y: 0.0  # diff drive robot

  max_vel_trans: 0.6 # choose slightly less than the base's capability - Setting the same as max_vel_x
  min_vel_trans: 0.1  # this is the min trans velocity when there is negligible rotational velocity
  trans_stopped_vel: 0.1
  # Do not set min_trans_vel (now min_vel_trans) or trans_stopped_vel to 0, 0.1 seems to work fine.
  # Anything below 0.1 for min_trans_vel (now min_vel_trans) can produce strange results.

  # Warning!
  #   do not set min_trans_vel (now min_vel_trans) to 0.0 otherwise dwa will always think translational velocities
  #   are non-negligible and small in place rotational velocities will be created.

  max_vel_theta: 3.6
  min_vel_theta: 0.0  # this is the min angular velocity when there is negligible translational velocity
  # Setting min_vel_theta above zero means it will never travel in a straight line!
  theta_stopped_vel: 0.3 # Set the same as min_vel_theta? That is what Turtlebot Does.
  
   # Setting acc_lim_x & acc_lim_theta to real values causes DWA to behave oddly and fail to reach goals.
  acc_lim_x: 4.0
  # 2.5 seems to be a minimum that works well.
  acc_lim_theta: 20.0
  # 20 seems extreme, but it works well.
  acc_lim_y: 0.0      # diff drive robot

# Trajectory Scoring Parameters
  # As of Melodic the defaults have changed due to bugs in how the previous versions calculated
  # https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/pull/763/files

  forward_point_distance: 0.325 # 0.325  - how far along to place an additional scoring point
  stop_time_buffer: 0.2         # 0.2    - amount of time a robot must stop in before colliding for a valid traj.
  scaling_speed: 0.25           # 0.25   - absolute velocity at which to start scaling the robot's footprint
  max_scaling_factor: 0.2       # 0.2    - how much to scale the robot's footprint when at speed.

# Oscillation Prevention Parameters
  oscillation_reset_dist: 0.05  # 0.05   - how far to travel before resetting oscillation flags
